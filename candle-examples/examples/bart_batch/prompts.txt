The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.
Scientists have discovered a high-redshift black hole that existed when the universe was only 750 million years old, making it one of the earliest supermassive black holes ever observed. The black hole, located approximately 13 billion light-years from Earth, has a mass equivalent to 1.6 billion suns. Researchers used data from the James Webb Space Telescope to identify the object, which challenges existing theories about how quickly black holes can grow in the early universe. The discovery suggests that some black holes may have formed from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds rather than from the remnants of early stars.
The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the lungs of the Earth, produces approximately 20 percent of the world's oxygen and is home to an estimated 10 percent of all species on the planet. Spanning across nine countries in South America, with the majority located in Brazil, the rainforest covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometers. However, deforestation rates have accelerated in recent years, with scientists warning that the ecosystem is approaching a critical tipping point. If current trends continue, large portions of the rainforest could transform into savanna within decades, releasing billions of tons of stored carbon into the atmosphere and dramatically accelerating climate change.
Researchers at MIT have developed a new type of battery that could revolutionize energy storage for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The battery uses aluminum and sulfur as its primary components, both of which are abundant and inexpensive compared to the lithium used in current battery technology. In laboratory tests, the new battery demonstrated the ability to charge in under one minute and maintain stable performance over hundreds of charge cycles. The technology also operates safely at high temperatures without the risk of fire that plagues lithium-ion batteries. Scientists estimate that the manufacturing cost could be one-sixth that of current lithium-ion batteries once production is scaled up.
