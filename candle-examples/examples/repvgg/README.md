[RepVGG: Making VGG-style ConvNets Great Again](https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.03697).

This candle implementation uses a pre-trained RepVGG network for inference. The
classification head has been trained on the ImageNet dataset and returns the
probabilities for the top-5 classes.

## Running an example
