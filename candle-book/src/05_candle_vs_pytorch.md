# 4. Candle vs PyTorch

## Introduction

This chapter provides a comparison between Candle, written in Rust, and PyTorch, written in Python with C++ backends. 

Both Candle and PyTorch are designed to provide flexible, efficient tools for building and training neural networks. However, they differ significantly in their design philosophy, performance characteristics, and ecosystem. This chapter will explore these differences and provide practical examples to illustrate how common deep learning tasks are implemented in each framework.

## Language Foundations: Rust vs Python

### Programming Paradigms

**PyTorch** is built on **Python**, which offers:
- Dynamic typing and interpretation
- Ease of use and rapid prototyping
- Extensive scientific computing ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, etc.)
- Garbage collection for memory management

**Candle** is built on **Rust**, which offers:
- Static typing and compilation
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Ownership system for resource management
- Performance comparable to C/C++
- Strong concurrency guarantees

### Code Example: Basic Tensor Creation

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
print(f"PyTorch tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Data type: {tensor.dtype}")
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a tensor
    let tensor = Tensor::new(&[[1.0f32, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], &Device::Cpu)?;
    println!("Candle tensor: {}", tensor);
    println!("Shape: {:?}", tensor.shape());
    println!("Data type: {:?}", tensor.dtype());
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Performance Implications

The language foundations have significant implications for performance:

1. **Compilation vs Interpretation**: Rust code is compiled to native machine code, while Python code is interpreted (though PyTorch operations are executed in C++/CUDA).

2. **Memory Management**: Rust's ownership system allows for efficient memory usage without garbage collection pauses, which can be beneficial for large-scale training.

3. **Static vs Dynamic Typing**: Rust's static typing catches errors at compile time, while Python's dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors.

## Tensor Operations and APIs
Here is an overview of some operations on Tensors.
As you can see, both frameworks have a lot in common. 

### Creating Tensors

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch

# From Python lists
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Zeros and ones
zeros = torch.zeros((2, 3))
ones = torch.ones((2, 3))

# Random tensors
random = torch.rand(2, 3)

# Arange and linspace
range_tensor = torch.arange(0, 10, 1)
linspace = torch.linspace(0, 10, 11)

# On specific device
gpu_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], device="cuda:0")
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let device = Device::Cpu;
    
    // From Rust arrays
    let tensor1 = Tensor::new(&[1, 2, 3, 4], &device)?;
    
    // Zeros and ones
    let zeros = Tensor::zeros((2, 3), candle_core::DType::F32, &device)?;
    let ones = Tensor::ones((2, 3), candle_core::DType::F32, &device)?;
    
    // Random tensors
    let random = Tensor::rand(0f32, 1f32, (2, 3), &device)?;
    
    // Arange
    let range_tensor = Tensor::arange(0f32, 10f32, 1f32, &device)?;
    
    // On GPU (if available)
    let gpu_device = Device::cuda_if_available(0)?;
    let gpu_tensor = Tensor::new(&[1, 2, 3], &gpu_device)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Basic Operations

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch

a = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

# Addition
c = a + b  # or torch.add(a, b)

# Multiplication
d = a * b  # element-wise, or torch.mul(a, b)

# Matrix multiplication
e = a @ b  # or torch.matmul(a, b)

# Functions
f = torch.sin(a)
g = torch.log(a)
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let device = Device::Cpu;
    
    let a = Tensor::new(&[[1.0f32, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], &device)?;
    let b = Tensor::new(&[[5.0f32, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], &device)?;
    
    // Addition
    let c = a.add(&b)?;
    
    // Multiplication
    let d = a.mul(&b)?;
    
    // Matrix multiplication
    let e = a.matmul(&b)?;
    
    // Functions
    let f = a.sin()?;
    let g = a.log()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### API Philosophy Differences

1. **Method Chaining vs Operator Overloading**:
   - PyTorch uses operator overloading extensively (`a + b`, `a * b`)
   - Candle uses method chaining with Result handling (`a.add(&b)?`)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - PyTorch raises exceptions for errors
   - Candle uses Rust's Result type for error handling

3. **Mutability**:
   - PyTorch operations can be in-place (with `_` suffix) or create new tensors
   - Candle operations typically create new tensors, following Rust's preference for immutability

## Neural Network Building Blocks

### Defining a Simple Network

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

# Create model
model = SimpleNN(10, 50, 2)
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device, Result};
use candle_nn::{Linear, Module, VarBuilder};

struct SimpleNN {
    layer1: Linear,
    layer2: Linear,
}

impl SimpleNN {
    fn new(
        input_size: usize, 
        hidden_size: usize, 
        output_size: usize, 
        vb: VarBuilder
    ) -> Result<Self> {
        let layer1 = candle_nn::linear(input_size, hidden_size, vb.pp("layer1"))?;
        let layer2 = candle_nn::linear(hidden_size, output_size, vb.pp("layer2"))?;
        
        Ok(Self { layer1, layer2 })
    }
}

impl Module for SimpleNN {
    fn forward(&self, x: &Tensor) -> Result<Tensor> {
        let x = self.layer1.forward(x)?;
        let x = x.relu()?;
        let x = self.layer2.forward(&x)?;
        Ok(x)
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let device = Device::Cpu;
    let vb = VarBuilder::zeros(candle_core::DType::F32, &device);
    
    // Create model
    let model = SimpleNN::new(10, 50, 2, vb)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```


## Training Models

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define model, loss, optimizer
model = SimpleNN(10, 50, 2)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in data_loader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device, Result};
use candle_nn::{Module, VarBuilder, VarMap, Optimizer};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let device = Device::Cpu;
    
    // Define model, loss, optimizer
    let mut varmap = VarMap::new();
    let vb = VarBuilder::from_varmap(&varmap, candle_core::DType::F32, &device);
    let model = SimpleNN::new(10, 50, 2, vb)?;
    let mut optimizer = candle_nn::AdamW::new(varmap.all_vars(), 0.001)?;
    
    // Training loop
    for epoch in 0..num_epochs {
        for (inputs, targets) in data_loader {
            // Forward pass
            let outputs = model.forward(&inputs)?;
            let loss = candle_nn::loss::mse(&outputs, &targets)?;
            
            // Backward pass and optimize
            optimizer.backward_step(&loss)?;
            
            println!("Epoch {}, Loss: {}", epoch, loss.to_scalar::<f32>()?);
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Key Differences in Training

1. **Automatic Differentiation**:
   - PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs with `backward()` calls
   - Candle uses a similar approach but with Rust's ownership system

2. **Optimizers**:
   - PyTorch has a wide range of built-in optimizers
   - Candle provides common optimizers like SGD and Adam

3. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - PyTorch has mature CUDA support with extensive optimizations
   - Candle offers CUDA support with growing optimizations

## Performance Comparison

### Computational Performance

Candle, being built on Rust, can offer performance advantages in certain scenarios:

1. **CPU Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and SIMD optimizations can make Candle competitive or faster than PyTorch on CPU for some operations.

2. **Memory Usage**: Candle typically uses less memory due to Rust's ownership system and lack of garbage collection overhead.

3. **GPU Performance**: PyTorch currently has more mature GPU optimizations due to its longer development history, but Candle is rapidly improving.

### Code Example: Benchmarking Matrix Multiplication

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch
import time

# Create large matrices
a = torch.rand(1000, 1000, device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
b = torch.rand(1000, 1000, device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Benchmark
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    torch.cuda.synchronize()  # Ensure GPU operations complete
end_time = time.time()

print(f"PyTorch time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

**Candle:**
```rust
use candle_core::{Tensor, Device};
use std::time::Instant;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Use CUDA if available
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available(0)?;
    
    // Create large matrices
    let a = Tensor::rand(0f32, 1f32, (1000, 1000), &device)?;
    let b = Tensor::rand(0f32, 1f32, (1000, 1000), &device)?;
    
    // Benchmark
    let start_time = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..100 {
        let c = a.matmul(&b)?;
        // Ensure operation completes
        if device.is_cuda() {
            device.synchronize()?;
        }
    }
    let duration = start_time.elapsed();
    
    println!("Candle time: {:.4} seconds", duration.as_secs_f32());
    
    Ok(())
}
```
