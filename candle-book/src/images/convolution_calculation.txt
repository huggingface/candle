Convolution Calculation Diagram Description

This file describes the design for a convolution calculation visualization to be created and saved as convolution_calculation.png.

OVERALL LAYOUT:
- A horizontal flow diagram showing the convolution process from left to right
- Clean, professional style with consistent colors and clear labels
- Size approximately 800x400 pixels

COMPONENTS WITH SAMPLE VALUES:

1. INPUT MATRIX (Left side):
   - A 5x5 grid representing an input image patch
   - Use these specific values for clarity:
     [1 2 3 2 1]
     [2 3 4 3 2]
     [3 4 5 4 3]
     [2 3 4 3 2]
     [1 2 3 2 1]
   - Label: "Input (5x5)"
   - Color: Light blue background for the matrix (#D6EAF8 or similar)

2. KERNEL/FILTER (Top center):
   - A 3x3 grid representing the convolution kernel
   - Use these specific weights (horizontal edge detection):
     [1  1  1]
     [0  0  0]
     [-1 -1 -1]
   - Label: "Kernel (3x3)"
   - Color: Light green background (#D5F5E3 or similar)

3. SLIDING WINDOW PROCESS (Center):
   - Show 3 positions of the kernel overlaid on the input:
     * Position 1: Top-left corner (kernel overlapping first 3x3 region of input)
     * Position 2: One step to the right (column 2)
     * Position 3: One step down from position 1 (row 2, column 1)
   - Use semi-transparent overlay (30-40% opacity) to show the kernel position
   - Highlight the current position (Position 1) with a bold border

4. CALCULATION DETAILS (Center-right):
   - For Position 1 (top-left), show the element-wise multiplication:
     [1×1  1×2  1×3]
     [0×2  0×3  0×4]
     [-1×3 -1×4 -1×5]
   - Show the summation of these products:
     1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) = 6 - 12 = -6
   - Use arrows to indicate the mapping from multiplication to output
   - Include the formula: Output[i,j] = Σ(Input[i+m,j+n] × Kernel[m,n])

5. OUTPUT FEATURE MAP (Right side):
   - A 3x3 grid showing the result of the convolution
   - Include these calculated values:
     [-6 -6 -6]
     [-6 -6 -6]
     [-6 -6 -6]
   - Label: "Output Feature Map (3x3)"
   - Color: Light orange background (#FAE5D3 or similar)

ANNOTATIONS:
- Add clear arrows showing the flow from input → kernel application → output
- Include a brief title at the top: "2D Convolution Calculation"
- Add a small legend explaining the color coding
- Include a brief note explaining that this shows cross-correlation as implemented in CNNs
- Add a note that this example uses a horizontal edge detection filter

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Use a clean, minimalist design with adequate white space
- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica)
- Use a color scheme that's easy to distinguish but not too bright
- Ensure all text is readable at the intended display size
- Use thin grid lines to separate cells in matrices

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Draw.io (diagrams.net) - Free, web-based or desktop application
- Figma - Professional design tool with free tier
- Adobe Illustrator - Professional vector graphics editor
- PowerPoint or Keynote - Accessible options with basic shape tools

EXPORT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Export as PNG at 800x400 pixels resolution
- Save as "convolution_calculation.png" in the src/images/ directory
- Ensure the image has a transparent background or white background

VERIFICATION:
- After adding the image to the repository, verify it displays correctly in the documentation
- Check that the image is properly referenced in src/13_convolution_in_cnns.md
- Ensure the image is clear and readable at different zoom levels
