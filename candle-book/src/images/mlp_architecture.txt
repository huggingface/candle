MLP Network Architecture Visualization Description

This file describes the design for an MLP network architecture visualization to be created and saved as mlp_architecture.png.

OVERALL LAYOUT:
- A comprehensive visualization showing the Self-Attention Model architecture from Chapter 8
- Clean, professional style with consistent colors and clear labels
- Size approximately 800x600 pixels
- Split into main sections: overall architecture, detailed components, and key formulas

COMPONENTS:

1. OVERALL ARCHITECTURE (Top section):
   - Show the high-level structure of the Self-Attention Model
   - Include the main components in a vertical flow:
     * Input (token indices)
     * Embedding layer
     * Positional encoding
     * Self-attention mechanism
     * Feed-forward network
     * Layer normalization
     * Output projection (to vocabulary)
   - Use boxes for components with clear labels
   - Show data flow with arrows between components
   - Color: Light blue background for this section (#D6EAF8 or similar)

2. EMBEDDING AND POSITIONAL ENCODING (Middle-left section):
   - Expanded view of the embedding and positional encoding components
   - Show:
     * Token embedding lookup
     * Positional encoding generation (sinusoidal)
     * Addition of embeddings and positional encodings
   - Include dimensions (VOCAB_SIZE=26, HIDDEN_SIZE=256)
   - Color: Light green background for this section (#D5F5E3 or similar)

3. SELF-ATTENTION DETAIL (Middle-right section):
   - Detailed view of the SelfAttention component
   - Include:
     * Query, Key, Value projections
     * Attention score calculation
     * Softmax operation
     * Weighted aggregation
     * Output projection
   - Show the data flow with arrows
   - Color: Light yellow background for this section (#FEF9E7 or similar)

4. FEED-FORWARD NETWORK DETAIL (Bottom-left section):
   - Expanded view of the FeedForward component
   - Show:
     * First linear layer (HIDDEN_SIZE → HIDDEN_SIZE*4)
     * ReLU activation
     * Second linear layer (HIDDEN_SIZE*4 → HIDDEN_SIZE)
   - Include dimensions for each layer
   - Color: Light orange background for this section (#FAE5D3 or similar)

5. LAYER NORMALIZATION AND RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS (Bottom-right section):
   - Detailed view of how layer normalization and residual connections are applied
   - Show:
     * Pre-normalization approach (LayerNorm before self-attention and feed-forward)
     * Residual connections around self-attention and feed-forward blocks
     * Final layer normalization
   - Use dashed lines for residual connections
   - Color: Light purple background for this section (#E8DAEF or similar)

ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATIONS (Based on Chapter 8):
- Vocabulary size: 26 (letters A-Z)
- Hidden size: 256
- Sequence length: 10
- Feed-forward size: 1024 (4x hidden size)
- Layer normalization epsilon: 1e-5
- Pre-normalization approach (LayerNorm before each sub-layer)
- Residual connections around self-attention and feed-forward blocks

ANNOTATIONS:
- Add clear labels for all components
- Include the key equations:
  * Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T)V
  * Embedding + Positional Encoding
  * LayerNorm(x) = γ * (x - μ) / (σ + ε) + β
- Add a brief title at the top: "Self-Attention Model Architecture"
- Include a small legend explaining the color coding and components
- Add dimensions for each component (e.g., hidden_size=256, vocab_size=26)

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Use a clean, minimalist design with adequate white space
- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica)
- Use a color scheme that's easy to distinguish but not too bright
- Ensure all text is readable at the intended display size
- Use thin lines for connections and borders
- Use dashed lines for residual connections

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- For the overall architecture, use a vertical flow diagram
- For the self-attention component, show the key operations (projection, scoring, weighting)
- For the feed-forward network, show both linear layers and the activation function
- Use arrows to show the flow of information through the process
- Include small explanatory notes where helpful
- Show tensor shapes at key points in the network

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Python with matplotlib for creating the visualization
- Use matplotlib's gridspec for organizing the different components
- Consider using patches for boxes and arrows

EXPORT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Export as PNG at 800x600 pixels resolution
- Save as "mlp_architecture.png" in the src/images/ directory
- Ensure the image has a transparent background or white background

VERIFICATION:
- After adding the image to the repository, verify it displays correctly in the documentation
- Check that the image is properly referenced in src/08_building_your_first_neural_network.md
- Ensure the image is clear and readable at different zoom levels
