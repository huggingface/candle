Token Embeddings Visualization Description

This file describes the design for a token embeddings visualization to be created and saved as token_embeddings.png.

OVERALL LAYOUT:
- A comprehensive visualization showing the token embedding process and semantic relationships
- Clean, professional style with consistent colors and clear labels
- Size approximately 800x500 pixels
- Split into three main sections: embedding lookup (left), embedding space (right), and dimensionality reduction (bottom)

COMPONENTS:

1. EMBEDDING LOOKUP PROCESS (Left side):
   - Show the process of converting token IDs to embedding vectors
   - Include:
     * A list of example tokens with their IDs: ["king", "queen", "man", "woman", "apple", "orange"]
     * The corresponding token IDs: [42, 57, 18, 25, 101, 152]
     * An embedding matrix E of shape (vocabulary_size, embedding_dim)
     * Arrows showing the lookup process: token ID → row in embedding matrix → embedding vector
   - Use a simplified embedding matrix with vocabulary_size = 1000 and embedding_dim = 300
   - Show only a small portion of the matrix with the relevant rows highlighted
   - Color: Light blue background for this section (#D6EAF8 or similar)

2. EMBEDDING MATRIX REPRESENTATION (Left-center):
   - Visual representation of the embedding matrix E
   - Show as a large rectangle with dimensions labeled:
     * Width = embedding_dim (300)
     * Height = vocabulary_size (1000)
   - Highlight specific rows corresponding to the example tokens
   - Include the mathematical notation: E[token_id] = embedding vector
   - Color: Light green background for the matrix (#D5F5E3 or similar)

3. EMBEDDING SPACE VISUALIZATION (Right side):
   - A 2D plot showing the semantic relationships between tokens in the embedding space
   - Position semantically similar words closer together:
     * "king" and "queen" should be close
     * "man" and "woman" should be close
     * "apple" and "orange" should be close
     * The pairs should form a parallelogram: king - queen ≈ man - woman
   - Use a scatter plot with clear labels for each token
   - Add vectors showing relationships (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen")
   - Color: Light yellow background for this section (#FEF9E7 or similar)

4. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION ILLUSTRATION (Bottom):
   - Show how high-dimensional embeddings are projected to 2D for visualization
   - Include:
     * A representation of high-dimensional vectors (300D)
     * Arrows pointing to a 2D projection
     * Labels for dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, PCA)
   - Use a simplified visual that conveys the concept without being too complex
   - Color: Light purple background for this section (#E8DAEF or similar)

ANNOTATIONS:
- Add clear labels for all components
- Include the key equations:
  * embedding(token_id) = E[token_id]
  * Similar tokens have similar vector representations
  * king - man + woman ≈ queen (vector arithmetic example)
- Add a brief title at the top: "Token Embeddings Visualization"
- Include a small legend explaining the color coding and components

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Use a clean, minimalist design with adequate white space
- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica)
- Use a color scheme that's easy to distinguish but not too bright
- Ensure all text is readable at the intended display size
- Use thin lines for connections and borders

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- For the embedding space visualization, use actual 2D coordinates that demonstrate the relationships
- For the dimensionality reduction, use a simplified visual representation that conveys the concept
- Use arrows to show the flow of information through the process
- Include small explanatory notes where helpful

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Python with matplotlib for creating the visualization
- Use matplotlib's plotting capabilities for the embedding space
- Consider using subplots to organize the different components

EXPORT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Export as PNG at 800x500 pixels resolution
- Save as "token_embeddings.png" in the src/images/ directory
- Ensure the image has a transparent background or white background

VERIFICATION:
- After adding the image to the repository, verify it displays correctly in the documentation
- Check that the image is properly referenced in src/17_token_embeddings.md
- Ensure the image is clear and readable at different zoom levels
